## Gym Membership NFT System

This repository contains a Solidity-based smart contract that manages gym memberships through NFTs. Each NFT represents a unique gym membership, offering secure, decentralized access control and membership verification.

# Overview

This system allows gym owners to issue, manage, and verify memberships as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, immutability, and secure ownership transfer.

# Features

NFT Memberships: Each gym membership is minted as an ERC-721 token.

Ownership Verification: Secure and easy verification of membership status directly on-chain.

Transferable Memberships: Users can securely transfer memberships to others.

Expiration Management: Memberships have an expiration feature, automatically invalidating access after the set period.

Membership Renewal: Users can renew their memberships by interacting with the smart contract.
